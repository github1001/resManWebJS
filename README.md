# Resident manager web app

//This is similar to the resManWeb, I failed using Twilio a chatting messaging system but managed to get it to work with Firebase. This is one that works with Firebase and corroborates with resManApp. The idea was to make them work together

//To run it do a npm install. Use a@a.com, 123456 for the dashboard

//Please get and upload your own key configuration from firebase and edit them at firebaseconfig.js before running them
